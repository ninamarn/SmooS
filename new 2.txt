ADDING SOME NEW TEXT TO THIS
I SHALL ADD SOMETHING *DIFFERENT* TO THIS ONE!
ALSO, NINA IS VERY SILLY

The Council of the Truth has declared that Marco, indeed, is the silly one.
And now, to add a final note, and squash. 
And than also this. Instead of three, there shall be one. 

\strikethrough{Addendum: An appeal to the grand high council of Truer-than-truth (having superceding authority on Truths) has determined that, contrary to the earlier rulings of the lower court, Nina is in fact the truly silly one and that Marco is innocent on all counts}.

That is all.
